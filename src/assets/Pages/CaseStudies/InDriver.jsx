            Given the common problems people face with using InDriver, which are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>The automated support system is unresponsive.</li>
              <li>Some drivers contact riders outside the app inappropriately.</li>
              <li>Some drivers change trip fares when they arrive at the pickup locations after they have been agreed upon.</li>
              <li>Profit from ride fares reduces as trips get longer because the agreed prices do not change.</li>
              <li>Taking too much time to find available drivers and other GPS issues.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Users rarely get any support for errors with locating drivers or inappropriate driver behaviour and fixed fares become a detriment to the drivers' profit when the time taken for a trip is longer than usual.

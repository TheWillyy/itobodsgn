            </br>Ensure the tracker is not too different from existing trackers, but more minimalist.
            </br>Make it easy to log multiple sets of workouts in seconds. 
            
            </br></br>To achieve this, we:
            </br>Used minimal Visual elements, even down to colour, keeping it mainly grayscale to imitate pen and whiteboard and marker you’d find in the gym.
            </br>Provided a list of workouts to select from, even helping the user learn routine names.
            </br>Categorised routines by type to keep them organized and neat"

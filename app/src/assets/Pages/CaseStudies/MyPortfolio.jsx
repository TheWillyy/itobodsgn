              It had all of the work, but that seemed a problem because I spent more time on more structured projects than explorations and there needed to be a clear distinction between them.

              Goals:
              </br>Separate work into case studies, dump and literature.
              </br>Create easily customizable components for each work entry and page.
              </br>Make a personal site that resonates with my skill and character"

              This helped realign my perspective to the 5-second window of opportunity to intoduce yourself and your work with the section above the fold to keep it simple. Everything else can be as flexible as needed.
              </br></br>
              Technical know-how for building modern and stylish interaction and design into the website could have cost more than budgeted, so I stuck to something simpler.
              I ran guerilla tests to qualitatively evaluate the simplicity and findability of each section and sub-page."

              However, it was lovely to implement animations and micro-interactions as they’re a significant part of my identity in product exploration and design.
              
              </br></br>
              <b>Challenges I faced during implementation:</b>
              </br>There were many stumbling blocks, however, one of the most notable was navigation and page transition. I wanted to implement a stylized page transition effect but with React.JS, route changing is usually instant and not directly customizable, so I used framer-motion to handle the transition effect, eventually running into the so-called learning curve I avoided."
